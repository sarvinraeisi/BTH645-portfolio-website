            <p>I edited this image using "Gimp". I changed some colors like the eye, drink, and straw color by selecting
                those areas
                and changing the color. Also I selected the edge of the whole picture and dragged it to the left corner
                to make a mini version of the picture. Finally I selected the rabbit's lips and rotated it to make it
                smile:) <br>
                The edited file size is 1.55MB which is slightly larger than the original file size. The horizontal and
                vertical
                resolution are 72dpi which is less than the original image resolution.

            <p>I drew this image with "sketchbook". The main thing that we have to keep in mind in drawing a picture is
                having layers.
                For instance the first thing that we draw when drawing an eye is a circle. That circle is not visible in
                the final picture
                because later on we hide the basic layers to have a neat picture. There are many brushes that we
                can use
                for different purposes. Also, there is a tool called "predictive stroke" which by setting it to max we
                can draw a perfect circle.<br>

            <h1>Image guidelines</h1>
            
            <ol>
                <li>The file size should be reasonable, especially if it's not for presenting an art work. Because users
                    might not be able to load the image due to poor internet connection if the file size is huge.</li>
                <li>Images should have the "alt" attribute in case the image can not be loaded. This way the user at
                    least knows what the image is about </li>
                <li>It's good to have caption for the images to give a short description about the image and avoid any
                    confusion.</li>
                <li>Images should have a reasonable resolution. If the image is for a website, the resolution should be
                    at
                    least 72dpi. However, if the image is for printing, the resolution should be at least 300dpi.</li>
                <li>The size and position of the image should be appropriate in comparison to other parts of the
                    website. For instance, if we are using several images it is best to keep them aligned.</li>
            </ol>
