                The last thing I saw was my alarm clock flashing 12:07 before she pushed her long rotting nails through
                my chest, her other hand muffling my screams. I sat bolt upright, relieved it was only a dream, but as I
                saw my alarm clock read 12:06, I heard my closet door creak open.

                <p>This is the editted version of my recording which is editted with Audocity. The first thing I did was
                    importing the above files to Audocity. Then I lowered the intensity of the sound effect since I
                    wanted to be background for my original recording. Then I selected the last 10 seconds of the second
                    file and trimmed it since it was excess. Finally I exported the final audio as mp3.</p><br>

                    The ideal audio format to add on a website depends on individuals needs. I personally
                    decided to use mp3 format for my audio files because it can be played on most
                    browsers and devices, and maintains a
                    decent balance between audio quality and file size.<br>
                    But as I mentioned before, one might think about using other formats
                    like AAC, OGG, or WAV if they need to maintain a better level of audio quality.
                    While these formats may produce higher file sizes, they provide audio
                    quality that is better than MP3.<br><br>
                    Regarding the usability I tried to consider the following points:<br>
                </p>



            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>I tried to make the audio accessible to all users by providing a transcript.
                    By clicking on the "Transcript" button user can hide or show the transcript.</li>

                <li>I provided user with control over audio. Meaning user can play/pause the audio, and adjust the
                    volume and playback speed.</li>
                <li>The audio won't autoplay upon opening the page as it can be annoying for users.</li>
                <li>I chose mp3 to give the user a decent quality with a small file size so they can open the file even
                    if they have a poor internet connection. Also, mp3 is compatible with a wide range of browsers and
                    devices.</li>
            </ul><br><br>
