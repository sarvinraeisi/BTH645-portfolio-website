                As I crawled into bed, I noticed a small, dark figure in the corner of my room. At first, I thought it
                was just my imagination, but as my eyes
                adjusted to the darkness, I realized it was a doll. It wasn't just any doll though, it was my childhood
                doll that I had lost years ago. I shook my head,
                trying to dispel the fear that was creeping up inside of me, but when I looked back, the doll was gone.
                Suddenly, I felt tiny hands wrap around my ankle
                and I knew I wasn't alone in the room.

                <p>In this assignment I've gathered and editted some images and audio files. These are the steps I took:

                </p>
                <li>Looked for  a short scary story which is suitable for the time limit of this assignment. </li>
                <li>Using a drawing AI generated lots of images and picked the most proper ones.</li>
                <li>Recorded My voice with Audacity application and adjusted the volume.</li>
                <li>Looked for royalty-free background audios and sound effects and chose the best matches.</li>
                <li>Created title and reference page using <a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva.com</a>.</li>
                <li>Transferred all of the files I previously gathered to OPS</li>
                <li>Added the background sound and set the volume to 10%. The background sound starts from the very beginning and is played in the entire video.</li>
                <li>Added the speech and soundeffects. I then sliced the speech because I wanted to use just sound effects in some parts. For instance, in one part of
                     the video we can only hear frightened breathing. I did this to make the video a bit more scary.</li>
                <li>Added title page, images, and reference page and positioned them according to the audio. I also added some effects to images in some parts to make them more spooky.</li>
            </ol>
